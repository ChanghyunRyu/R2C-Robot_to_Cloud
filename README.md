R2C(Robot-to-Cloud) is a simple project of implementing Cloud Server that computes SLAM mapping and merging for robots.  

This project was written for a final team project for Next-generation distributed system class. R2C is proposed to provide operations that are difficult in robotic embedded systems. To this end, we implement a cloud server using Kubernetes.
